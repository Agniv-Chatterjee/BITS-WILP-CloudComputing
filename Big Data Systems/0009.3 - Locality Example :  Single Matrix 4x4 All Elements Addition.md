Sure, let's go through an example of adding all elements of a 4x4 matrix using row-major order with a 4-word cache.

### Matrix:
```
| 1  2  3  4 |
| 5  6  7  8 |
| 9  10 11 12|
| 13 14 15 16|
```

### Cache Configuration:
- Cache Size: 4 words
- Cache Line Size: 1 word
- Cache Associativity: Direct-mapped (one cache line per set)

### Memory Access Sequence:
1. **Good Access (Cache Hit)**: Accessing data that is already in the cache.

2. **Bad Access (Cache Miss)**: Accessing data that is not in the cache, requiring a fetch from main memory.

### Cache State Table:

| Cache Line | Valid | Tag  | Data |
|------------|-------|------|------|
| 0          | No    | -    | -    |
| 1          | No    | -    | -    |
| 2          | No    | -    | -    |
| 3          | No    | -    | -    |

### Operation:

```plaintext
Sum = 0

Iterating through the matrix in row-major order:
1. Access element (1,1):
   - Cache Miss (0th cache line): Load row 1 from main memory into the cache.
   - Cache State Table:
     | Cache Line | Valid | Tag  | Data |
     |------------|-------|------|------|
     | 0          | Yes   | 0    | 1  2  3  4 |

2. Access element (1,2):
   - Good Access (0th cache line): Data is already in the cache.
   - Cache State Table (No change):

3. Access element (1,3):
   - Good Access (0th cache line): Data is already in the cache.
   - Cache State Table (No change):

4. Access element (1,4):
   - Good Access (0th cache line): Data is already in the cache.
   - Cache State Table (No change):

5. Access element (2,1):
   - Cache Miss (1st cache line): Load row 2 from main memory into the cache.
   - Cache State Table:
     | Cache Line | Valid | Tag  | Data |
     |------------|-------|------|------|
     | 0          | Yes   | 0    | 1  2  3  4 |
     | 1          | Yes   | 1    | 5  6  7  8 |

6. Access element (2,2):
   - Good Access (1st cache line): Data is already in the cache.
   - Cache State Table (No change):

7. Access element (2,3):
   - Good Access (1st cache line): Data is already in the cache.
   - Cache State Table (No change):

8. Access element (2,4):
   - Good Access (1st cache line): Data is already in the cache.
   - Cache State Table (No change):

9. Access element (3,1):
   - Cache Miss (2nd cache line): Load row 3 from main memory into the cache.
   - Cache State Table:
     | Cache Line | Valid | Tag  | Data |
     |------------|-------|------|------|
     | 0          | Yes   | 0    | 1  2  3  4 |
     | 1          | Yes   | 1    | 5  6  7  8 |
     | 2          | Yes   | 2    | 9  10 11 12|

10. Access element (3,2):
    - Good Access (2nd cache line): Data is already in the cache.
    - Cache State Table (No change):

11. Access element (3,3):
    - Good Access (2nd cache line): Data is already in the cache.
    - Cache State Table (No change):

12. Access element (3,4):
    - Good Access (2nd cache line): Data is already in the cache.
    - Cache State Table (No change):

Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78
```

### Summary:

- With a cache size of 4 words and a row-major access pattern, the entire 4x4 matrix can be stored in the cache at once.
- All data accesses result in cache hits after the initial cache miss, resulting in efficient data retrieval and addition.
