### Features of Real-Time Architecture

Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the key features of real-time architecture, including high availability, low latency, and horizontal scalability:

---

1. **High Availability**:
   - **Distinction from Batch/BI Systems**: High availability is a critical differentiator between real-time systems and traditional batch or Business Intelligence (BI) systems, where downtime can be tolerated. Real-time systems must ensure continuous operation.
   - **Critical for Collection, Flow, and Processing Systems**: For real-time architectures, maintaining availability during data collection, event flow, and processing is essential to prevent data loss and ensure timely insights.
   - **Two Approaches**:
     - **Distribution**:
       - **Load Distribution**: Utilizing multiple physical servers helps distribute the workload evenly across the system, minimizing the risk of overload on any single server.
       - **Improved Fault Tolerance**: If one server fails, others can take over, ensuring that the system remains operational.
     - **Replication**:
       - **Writing to Several Machines**: Data is written simultaneously to multiple machines to ensure that a backup is always available in case of failure.
       - **Master-Slave Configuration**: In this setup, a master server handles writes, while slave servers replicate data, providing redundancy and load balancing.
       - **Automatic Failover**: If the master server fails, the system can automatically switch to a slave server to maintain operations.
       - **Masterless Configuration**: This approach eliminates the single point of failure inherent in master-slave setups, but recovery can be more complex in case of failures.

2. **Low Latency**:
   - **Request Service Time**: Low latency refers to the minimal time taken to service a request within the system. For real-time applications, quick response times are crucial.
   - **Streaming Systems Latency**:
     - **Event Processing Time**: Latency is measured as the time taken to process an event from the moment it enters the system until the response is generated.
     - **Micro-Batching**: Many streaming systems employ micro-batching, processing data in very small batches (milliseconds) to enhance throughput while maintaining low latency.
   - **Component Considerations**:
     - **Collection Systems**: These systems primarily focus on the initial definition of latency, which involves the speed of capturing and transmitting data.
     - **Flow and Processing Components**: These components address the time taken to process the captured events, ensuring that the overall system remains responsive.
   - **Tradeoff Between Speed and Safety**:
     - **Acceptable Data Loss**: If the system can tolerate some data loss, it can achieve lower latencies by optimizing for speed.
     - **Data Integrity**: Conversely, if data integrity is paramount, the system must incorporate mechanisms that may introduce additional latency to ensure that no data is lost during processing.

3. **Horizontal Scalability**:
   - **Physical Server Addition**: Horizontal scalability involves adding more physical servers to a cluster to handle increased workloads effectively.
   - **Coordination Challenges**: As more servers are added, managing coordination between the systems becomes increasingly complex, necessitating robust communication and data synchronization strategies.
   - **Partitioning Techniques**: Implementing partitioning techniques helps distribute data across multiple servers, ensuring efficient processing and reducing bottlenecks.
   - **Data Locality Principle**: The principle of data locality suggests moving the processing code closer to the data rather than transferring large amounts of data across the network. This reduces latency and improves performance.

### Conclusion

Real-time architecture must prioritize high availability, low latency, and horizontal scalability to effectively handle the demands of modern streaming applications. By implementing robust distribution and replication strategies, minimizing processing delays, and scaling horizontally, organizations can build systems capable of delivering timely insights while maintaining data integrity and availability.
