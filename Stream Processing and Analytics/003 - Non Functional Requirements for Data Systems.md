### Non-Functional Requirements for Data Systems

In addition to functional requirements (what the system does), non-functional requirements (how the system performs) are critical to ensure the success and usability of data systems. Here are three key non-functional requirements:

---

### 1. **Reliability**
   - **Definition**: The ability of the system to function correctly and consistently over time, even in the face of failures.
   - **Importance**: In data systems, failures such as hardware malfunctions, network issues, or software bugs can occur. The system must ensure that data is not lost and operations continue with minimal disruption.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Redundancy**: Replicate data and services across multiple servers or data centers.
     - **Fault tolerance**: Enable automatic recovery from failures, like switching to backup systems (e.g., Active-Passive Failover).
     - **Data replication**: Ensure data consistency and durability with multiple copies stored in different locations.

### 2. **Scalability**
   - **Definition**: The system’s ability to handle increased loads (more data, users, or queries) without performance degradation.
   - **Importance**: As data grows and more users interact with the system, the architecture should scale both horizontally (adding more machines) and vertically (adding resources to existing machines) to meet demands.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Horizontal scaling**: Add more nodes to distribute load (e.g., adding more database instances).
     - **Elastic scaling**: Dynamically adjust resources based on real-time demand (common in cloud infrastructure).
     - **Sharding/Partitioning**: Split data into manageable chunks across servers to balance load.

### 3. **Maintainability**
   - **Definition**: The ease with which the system can be updated, modified, or adapted to changes in the future.
   - **Importance**: Data systems evolve over time as business requirements change or new technologies emerge. Maintainability ensures that the system can be easily managed and improved without extensive downtime or errors.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Modular design**: Use microservices or decoupled architectures so that changes in one part of the system don’t disrupt others.
     - **Automated monitoring and logging**: Use tools to detect issues and ensure proactive maintenance.
     - **Continuous integration/Continuous deployment (CI/CD)**: Ensure rapid, reliable updates and deployments with minimal disruption.

---

Together, **reliability**, **scalability**, and **maintainability** form the foundation of robust, future-proof data systems.
