### Properties of Data

The properties of data are essential for understanding how data is managed, processed, and utilized within Big Data systems. Here are three key properties that define the nature and handling of data:

---

### 1. **Rawness**
- **Definition**: Refers to the level of detail and unprocessed state of the data.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Fine-Grained Data**: Data in its raw form contains detailed information, which allows for more granular analysis.
  - **Rich Queries**: Raw data enables various interesting queries and insights that may not be possible with aggregated or processed data.
  - **Unstructured vs. Structured**: 
    - **Unstructured Data** (e.g., text documents, images) is considered "rawer" than structured data (e.g., tables, spreadsheets) because it lacks a predefined schema and contains more inherent variability.
    - Rawness allows analysts to derive insights from data in its original context, preserving its full informational value.

### 2. **Immutability**
- **Definition**: Refers to the property that data cannot be deleted or updated; only new data can be added.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **No Deletions or Updates**: Once data is written, it remains unchanged, ensuring that the original data is preserved.
  - **Untouched Original Data**: This property allows for the retention of historical data, which can be crucial for auditing, compliance, and tracing data lineage.
  - **Ease of Recovery**: In case of failures or mistakes, the original data can be easily retrieved since it has not been altered.
  - **Simplicity**: 
    - Immutability simplifies data management since no indexing or complex data modification techniques are required. This can lead to easier data retrieval and lower chances of introducing errors during updates.

### 3. **Eternity**
- **Definition**: A consequence of the immutability property, suggesting that data persists indefinitely in its original state.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Purity and Truth**: Since data is never altered, it remains pure and true, reflecting its original condition and context.
  - **Timestamping**: To achieve this property, timestamps are often added to data entries. This allows for the tracking of when data was created and aids in understanding its relevance over time.
  - **Long-Term Storage**: Eternity implies that data can be retained for long periods, which is beneficial for historical analysis, compliance with regulations, and gaining insights from past events.

### Summary

These properties—**Rawness**, **Immutability**, and **Eternity**—are vital for understanding how data can be effectively managed and utilized in Big Data systems. They highlight the importance of preserving the integrity and original context of data, which ultimately enhances the quality of insights derived from it. By ensuring that data remains raw, immutable, and eternal, organizations can leverage their data for better decision-making and strategic planning.
