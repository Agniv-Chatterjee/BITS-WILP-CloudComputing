### Lambda Architecture - Basic Flow of Events

The **Lambda Architecture** provides a structured approach to process large volumes of data by integrating both batch and real-time stream processing. Here’s a step-by-step overview of the basic flow of events in this architecture:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - All incoming data is dispatched to both the **Batch Layer** and the **Speed Layer** simultaneously. This ensures that both historical and real-time processing can occur in parallel.

2. **Batch Layer Functions**:
   - The Batch Layer has two primary functions:
     - **Managing the Master Dataset**: This dataset is an immutable, append-only store of raw data. It serves as the source of truth for all historical data.
     - **Precomputing Batch Views**: The batch layer processes the master dataset in defined intervals (e.g., hourly, daily) to create Batch Views, which summarize or aggregate the data for easier querying and analysis.

3. **Serving Layer**:
   - The Serving Layer indexes the Batch Views generated by the Batch Layer. This indexing allows for low-latency, ad-hoc queries. The goal is to provide users with quick access to historical data without the delays associated with processing large datasets in real-time.

4. **Speed Layer**:
   - The Speed Layer processes incoming real-time data. This layer deals exclusively with the most recent data and compensates for the latency that may occur in the updates to the Serving Layer. It ensures that users receive immediate insights into the latest events.

5. **Query Handling**:
   - Any incoming query can be answered by merging results from both the Batch Views (historical data) and the real-time views generated by the Speed Layer. This allows users to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data, blending historical trends with the most current events.

### Visual Representation

Here’s a simplified visual representation of the basic flow of events in Lambda Architecture:

```
                  +---------------------+
                  |     Data Sources     |
                  +---------------------+
                            |
                +-----------+-----------+
                |                       |
         +------+-----+         +-------+-----+
         |  Batch Layer |       |  Speed Layer  |
         |              |       |                |
         +------+-------+       +-------+--------+
                |                       |
                |                       |
         +------+--------+              |
         |  Serving Layer |<-------------+
         +----------------+
                |
         +------+------+
         |    Queries    |
         +---------------+
```

### Summary

The Lambda Architecture's basic flow of events allows for robust, scalable, and efficient data processing by leveraging the strengths of both batch and stream processing. By dispatching data to both layers and merging their outputs for queries, the architecture ensures that users have access to both historical insights and real-time analytics. This dual approach addresses the challenges of processing large-scale data while maintaining low latency for immediate decision-making.
