### Distinguishing Features of Streaming Data

Hereâ€™s an expanded explanation of the distinguishing features of streaming data, incorporating your provided details:

---

1. **Data Always in Motion**:
   - **Continuous Generation**: Streaming data is generated continuously from various sources such as sensors, social media, and applications. This constant generation means that data is perpetually flowing, necessitating real-time processing capabilities.
   - **Critical Requirements**:
     - **Robust Collection Systems**: The systems responsible for collecting streaming data must be resilient and capable of handling high volumes of incoming data without losing any events.
     - **Pace of Processing**: The processing layer must be able to keep pace with the incoming data to ensure timely analysis and decision-making. Delays in processing can lead to missed insights or opportunities.
   - **Solutions**:
     - **Horizontal Scalability**: Systems must be designed to scale horizontally, allowing for the addition of more machines or instances to accommodate increased data loads.
     - **Algorithmic Handling**: Employing algorithms specifically designed for streaming data, such as windowed computations and stateful processing, can enhance efficiency and effectiveness in handling real-time information.

2. **Data Structuring**:
   - **Loosely Structured**: Streaming data is often loosely structured, meaning it may not fit into a predefined schema. This flexibility allows for the integration of diverse data types and formats.
   - **Various Data Sources**:
     - **Structured and Unstructured Data**: Streaming data can originate from multiple sources, including both structured databases and unstructured sources like social media feeds, making it challenging to create a unified schema.
     - **Joint Schema Complexity**: Forming a joint schema for all data sources can be complex, especially when dealing with rapidly changing data from evolving projects.
   - **Young, Evolving Projects**:
     - **Adding Dimensions**: As projects mature, they often incorporate new data dimensions, leading to richer datasets but also increased complexity in data analysis.
     - **Data Collection Strategy**: It's essential to collect as much relevant data as possible to enable comprehensive analysis and insights.

3. **Data Cardinality**:
   - **Unique Value Distribution**: Streaming data typically exhibits high cardinality, meaning there are many unique values present in the dataset. In many cases, only a few values may appear frequently, while many are sparse.
   - **Challenges with Streaming Data**:
     - **Processing Limitations**: Streaming data is often processed in real time and only once. This can make it difficult to maintain the state of the data, as once the data is processed, it may not be stored for further examination.
     - **Batch Processing for Estimation**: In some cases, batch processing techniques can be applied on previously processed data to estimate trends or derive insights, but this cannot capture the immediacy of streaming data.
     - **Storage Requirements**:
       - **High Memory Usage**: Real-time processing demands significant memory resources, particularly as data volume increases. This high memory requirement can be a bottleneck.
       - **State Information**: A linear amount of space is often required for storing state information, which can complicate the management and scaling of the system.

### Conclusion

Understanding these distinguishing features of streaming data is crucial for designing systems that can effectively handle and analyze real-time information. The continuous nature of data generation, its loosely structured format, and the unique challenges associated with data cardinality all highlight the need for robust architectures and innovative solutions in streaming data applications.
